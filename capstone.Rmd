### Analysis of Australia, Argentina, and the United States.

```{r}
gap.in<-read.table("output/combined_gapMinder.tsv", sep = "\t", header = T)
us<-subset(gap.in, gap.in$country == "Australia" | gap.in$country =="Argentina"| gap.in$country == "United States")

australia<-subset(us, us$country == "Australia")
argentina<-subset(us, us$country == "Argentina")
unitedstates<-subset(us, us$country == "United States")

plot(australia$year, australia$gdpPercap, main = "Annual GDP per capita - Australia")
plot(argentina$year, argentina$gdpPercap, main = "Annual GDP per capita - Argentina")
plot(unitedstates$year, unitedstates$gdpPercap, main = "Annual GDP per capita - USA")

```

Argentina's growth is non-monotonic. The US has much larger values.

## Mean, min, and max life expectancy by country
```{r}
aggregate(x = us$lifeExp, by = list(us$country), FUN = "mean")
aggregate(x = us$lifeExp, by = list(us$country), FUN = "min")
aggregate(x = us$lifeExp, by = list(us$country), FUN = "max")



```

Australia has the highest values, followed by the United States.

```{r}

hist(gap.in$lifeExp, main = "Global Life Expectancy")
hist(gap.in$lifeExp, breaks = 30)
```
Many people are expected to live to about 70 years old.
